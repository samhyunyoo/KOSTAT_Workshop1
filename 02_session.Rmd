## R Markdown

This is just text, we can write as we like here.
Sometime you'll see me put code-like things in side of `back ticks`. That is just for text formatting, it isn't actually code.

To make an R snippet use `Ctrl Alt i`, commit to muscle memory

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
KOR <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timriffe/KOSTAT_Workshop1/master/Data/KOR2014.csv")
options(scipen = 999)
KOR |> # Ctrl Shift m
  mutate(mx = deaths / exposure) |> 
  filter(sex != "total") |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, y = mx, color = sex)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.00289,color = "#8a36ba") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16))
```
