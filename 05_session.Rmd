# Grammar of graphics

The grammar of graphics systematizes the mapping of data to aspects of a visualization. 

A mapping means a translation of a variable (qualitative, discrete, continuous) to coordinate, or aesthetic attributes of the target data visualization.

## Anatomy of a ggplot2 call

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
LT <- read_csv("Data/LT_results.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) 

LT %>% 
  filter(Country == "Algeria",
         Year == 2000) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    x = Age,
    y = nMx,
    color = Sex
  )) +
  geom_line()
```
