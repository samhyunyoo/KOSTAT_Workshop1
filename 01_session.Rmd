## Intro to R Markdown

Whatever I type freely like this, is just text. Nothing bad can happen to your document by just typing here. So take all the notes you want.

## Code chunks

Hot-key for making a code chunk: `Ctrl + Alt +i`

Inside the code chunk, we need to have valid `R` code. In order to build this document, whatever code is executed in the code blocks needs to successfully run. I argue that this forces the analysis to be reproducible, and this is a good artifact of working in markdown.
```{r}

```
